# Loops and Conditionals in R
## For Loops
# Make a vector called 'letters'
letters=c('A','B','C','D')
# Iterate through items in letters & print each letter
for(i in letters){ #for(index in set) {
print(i) #call function, call elements in set with 'i'
} #end loop
# Often we want to work perform a task on a subset of the data
# So, we can instead loop through a set of integers
# as long as the set
# Instead, loop through a set of integers as long as the set
# What does 1:length(letters) correspond to?
for(i in 1:length(letters)){
print(letters[i])
}
# A "best practice" for using loops in R is to store
# output from a loop in a variable with specified attributes,
# instead of appending - saves RAM
# Loop through letters, add "x" to each letter using paste()
# and store into a new vector called 'output'
#create a four character element called 'output'
output = character(length = length(letters))
#output = NULL #you'd use this if you didn't know the dimensions or mode of output
#Index is i, set is sequence of integers 1 through length(letters)
for(i in 1:length(letters)){
#for the ith element of output
#store ith element in letters along with an 'x' (Ax, Bx, etc.)
output[i] = paste(letters[i], "x", sep="")
}
output
## if-else statements
# Return output based on a condition
# The condition is set by a relational or logical operator
# Store "Wednesday" as a variable called Today
Today = "Wednesday"
# Use an if-else statement to see if we should celebrate or not
# If Today == "Friday" returns TRUE, print "Woo!", else print "Boo!"
if(Today == "Friday"){
print("Woo!")
} else {print("Boo!")
}
#if-else statements within a for loop
# A variable "WeekDays" is a character vector of the 5 days of the week
WeekDays <- c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday")
# Make an empty character vector called 'Is_It_Friday'
# with the same length as 'WeekDays' to hold output from the loop
Is_It_Friday <- character(length = length(WeekDays))
# Loop through the days of week
# Index is i, set is a sequence from 1 until 5 (the length of Weekdays)
for(i in 1:length(WeekDays)){
#if the ith element of WeekDays is "Friday"
if(WeekDays[i] == "Friday"){
#then make the ith element of Is_It_Friday "Woo!"
Is_It_Friday[i] = "Woo!"
#else, make the ith element of Is_It_Friday "Boo!"
} else{Is_It_Friday[i] = "Boo!"}
}
#print the variable Is_It_Friday
Is_It_Friday
# How does the code change if I want to include
# more than a single choice between two options?
# Loop through the days of week
# Index is i, set is a sequence from 1 until 5 (the length of Weekdays)
for(i in 1:length(WeekDays)){
#if the ith element of WeekDays "Friday"
if(WeekDays[i] == "Friday"){
#then make the ith element of Is_It_Friday "Woo!"
Is_It_Friday[i] = "Woo!"
#else, if the ith element of WeekDays is "Monday"
} else if(WeekDays[i] == "Monday"){
#then make the ith element of Is_It_Friday "BLARG"
Is_It_Friday[i] = "BLARG"
#else, make the ith element of Is_It_Friday "Boo!"
} else{Is_It_Friday[i] = "Boo!"}
}
